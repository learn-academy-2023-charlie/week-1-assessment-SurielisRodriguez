# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer: A conditional statment says that an action will occur is specific guidelines are met

Researched answer: Conditionals statements often use if/else statements so the program can evaluate a statement and make a determination on what action to take based on 

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is version control, github is a program that runs git

Researched answer: Git is version control that you can use to track changes in your work. Github is a cloud based repository that can help people change and save their programs and have others access or revise their code.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: logical operators

Researched answer: Logical operators return true and false responses and used the operators to create conditions  which can be relational, equality, and logical. These operators require the program to evalutate statements and make a determination, producing an output.

3. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: The index is where it is logically in the string/array, the value is going to be the data type value of the string/array.

Researched answer:

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Arrays and strings both are used to hold information and data, but the types of built in methods you can utilize are different. The same accessors or mutators would not work on both. Arrays are a collection of datatypes, whilst strings hold characters like names. 

Researched answer: Arrays can be completely manipulated and deconstructed bu using fucntions like .split and .join. Arrays are also zero indexed, meaning the start value of the array will always be zero, regardless or user input. A string is in an individual value, while an array holds can hold multiple. 

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: The driver is the programmer that is actually typing out the code, while the navigator is aiding the programmer by telling them what to do. The driver will make sure the instructions given are functional and to tell the navigator what issues or blockers arise during coing process.

Researched answer: Both programmers will be the navigator and the driver during the code writting process, but the driver will write the code, the navigator will double check all of the code written and make sure its good. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: Fucntions that can take function as a parameter or return fucntion as an output.

2. Jest: this is a javascript testing framework that verifies that the users code is fucntional. Test code validity that will show you holes in your code.

3. Objects: Variables used in coding that can hold several values relating to the same element.

4. Method: fucntions that can be applied to different objects. These could be code like .reverse or .indexOf

5. Classes: a blueprint to create more objects using the same characteristic for each.
